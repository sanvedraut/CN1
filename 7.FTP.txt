# =======================
# Experiment 7: File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
# =======================

# Step 1: Install FTP Client and Server
sudo apt-get -y install lftp
sudo apt update
sudo apt install proftpd

# Step 2: Check IP address (note it down, e.g., 192.168.29.26)
ip addr

# Step 3: Connect to FTP server
lftp -u <your-username> <your-ip-address>
# Example:
# lftp -u user 192.168.29.26

# Step 4: Basic FTP Commands
pwd             # Show current FTP directory
ls              # List files in current FTP directory

# Step 5: Create text files locally on your system
echo "Hello Ubuntu" > ubuntu.txt
echo "Test file 1" > test.txt
echo "Test file 2" > test2.txt
echo "print('Hello from Python')" > test.py

# Step 6: Upload files to FTP server
put -a ubuntu.txt                          # Upload single file
mput -a test.txt test2.txt                # Upload multiple files

# Step 7: Download files from FTP server
get -a test.py                             # Download single file
mget -a test.txt test2.txt                # Download multiple files

# Step 8: Directory operations on server
mkdir testdir                              # Create directory
ls                                         # Confirm it was created

rmdir testdir                              # Delete directory
ls                                         # Confirm it was deleted

# Step 9: Delete files on server
rm test2.txt                               # Delete single file
mrm ubuntu.txt test.txt                   # Delete multiple files
ls

# Step 10: Exit FTP
quit
